Easy Character Movement 2
=========================

  - ECM2 is now being distributed as two versions, one using the new Input System and another one without any external dependencies using the old Input Manager.

 - The Character Movement (asset store version) is now included as a separate package. This is aimed at developers who prefer to build their own movement mechanics on top of it without using any ECM2 features.


Installation:
--------------

  To install it, simply import the desired package. For example:

      - To import the ECM2 input manager version (aka old input), double click on the "ECM2 - Input Manager (aka Old input)" file.

      - To import the ECM2 input system version (aka new input), double click on the "ECM2 - Input System (aka New input)" file.

      - To import the CharacterMovement package (asset store version), double click on the "Character Movement v1.0.7" file.


  IMPORTANT NOTE:

  You should not install the Character Movement package if you intend to use ECM2 as this is already included with ECM2 versions.
